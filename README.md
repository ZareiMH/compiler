# compiler
This is the repository for the Spring 2020 Compiler course project where me and [@madsams](https://github.com/madsams) built a compiler for a custom language (the sample code can be found at `src/llvm-testfiles/`). 

The 3 `.pdf` files are the assignment and project descriptions.

Use this command to compile the parser.cup and see the results:

`cd parser && java -jar ../../lib/java-cup-11b.jar -parser Parser Parser.cup`
